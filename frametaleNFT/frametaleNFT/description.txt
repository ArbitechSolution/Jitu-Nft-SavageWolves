The logo is not final but the size and look will be exact same thing.
Menu should be at the top all the time like the example you sent. I donâ€™t need any instgram but need discord button. So homepage should be like in this order:
TOP ARTWORK
ABOUT with a simple gif and text
ROADMAP (need to change the colors/fonts)
TOKEN (pink background image, huge texts with a funny coin image/I will work on that but just put a placeholder for now)
TOKEN BENEFITS (exact same thing of your membership benefits but need color/font adjustment)
THE TEAM (3 short bio/3 nft image will provide it)
FAQ
JOIN THE COMMUNITY (discord part/will provide a background image)
FOOTER (needs logo/copyright/nft contract/token contract/social accounts)
